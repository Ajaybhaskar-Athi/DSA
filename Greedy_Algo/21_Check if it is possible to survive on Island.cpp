 /*total food we can buy in a week (6*N) is greater than or equal to total food we require to survive in a week (7*M) then we can survive. 

Note : We are buying the food in the first 6 days because we are counting from Monday and the shop will remain close on Sunday.
If any of the above conditions are not true then we canâ€™t survive else 
Also if daily_need_units> max unit u can buy one day => then u cant survive
